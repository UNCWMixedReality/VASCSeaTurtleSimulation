"Welcome! This is Module 1 of the VASC Sea Turtle Simulation."
"During this simulation, you will be asked to complete three tasks."
"Before you begin, let's go over the tools you'll be using."
"First, use your grip button (middle finger) to pick up the calipers on the left side of the table."
"Good job. You can press the A button on that controller to extend and the B button to retract the calipers."
"Looks like you've got the hang of it. Now it's time to use them. Extend the calipers to measure the container on the table by following the yellow arrow."
"Nice work! We're done with the calipers for now. Next, pick up the tape measure on the right side of the table."
"As you can see, when you're holding the tape measure, the tape will automatically follow your other hand."
"Use the tape measure to measure the clipboard. Move your hands to the ends of the yellow arrow to measure it."
"Great! Now that you know how to use the tools, you're ready to go. Move to the blue waypoint to get started."
"Your first task is to measure this sea turtle using the calipers on the flippers and the tape measure on the shell."
"Good job! You finished the first task! Move to the waypoint to continue."
"This task needs you to identify the sea turtles that appear on the table. Use your laser pointer to click the Load Turtle button to begin."
"Nice job! You finished the second task! Move to the waypoint to continue."
"This task needs you to identify the sets of turtle tracks that appear on the table. Use your laser pointer to click the Load Tracks button to begin."
"Excellent work! You finished the third task! That's all for the Module."
