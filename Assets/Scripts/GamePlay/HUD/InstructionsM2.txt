Welcome! This is Module 2 of the VASC Sea Turtle Simulation.
During this simulation, you will be asked to complete four tasks.
First, let's go over the tools you'll be using.
You can toggle this panel on and off using the B Button on your right controller.
To move around the scene, aim the laser pointer from your hand where you want to go on the floor, then press the trigger button to be teleported there.
Calipers: Use your controller's grip button to pick up the calipers in one hand. Move that same controller's joystick to extend and retract the calipers.
Shovel: Use your controller's grip button to pick up the shovel in one hand. Move the shovel's head to dig in certain areas of sand.
That's all for the tutorial, press the next button (Y) when you're ready to move on.
Alright, looks like you're ready to get started. Go ahead and move on to the first task.
Your first task is to dig up this turtle nest. Pick up the shovel and use it to dig in the sand until you can see the eggs.
Good job! Next, these eggs need to be moved. Some are cracked, though, and will need to be separated from the good eggs.
First, use the calipers to measure the eggs. Then, after you've measured each egg, if it's cracked, put it in the red bucket. If it's NOT cracked, put it in the green bucket.
Good job! You're ready to move on to the next task.
Here you need to place the eggs into their new nest. Take the eggs from the green bucket and place them into the new nest. The light blue sphere show where the eggs should go - place them on the blue spheres.
Good job! Now the nest needs to be covered up and protected.
Start by using the shovel to move some sand over the eggs.
Good job! Now all that's left is to place a protective covering over the nest.
Pick up the wireframe cage and place it on top of the nest.
Good job! That's all for this Module.
