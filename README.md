## Egg Sorting Activity:
- The egg sorting activity in the VascSeaTurtleSimulation project is an interactive experience where students are teleported to a virtual beach environment. In this activity, students are presented with two buckets and a pair of gloves. The goal of the activity is to carefully excavate a turtle nest and sort the eggs based on their condition. Students must put on the gloves provided and use them to dig up the nest carefully, making sure not to damage the eggs. They then need to sort the undamaged eggs into the green bucket and the damaged eggs into the red bucket carefully. Through this activity, students learn about the importance of preserving sea turtle nests and how to handle delicate objects with care. The egg sorting activity provides an immersive and hands-on learning experience for students, helping them to develop an appreciation for sea turtles and the significance of conservation efforts.

## Egg Relocation:
- The egg relocation activity in the VascSeaTurtleSimulation project is an immersive experience where students are relocated to a virtual beach environment. This activity follows the egg sorting activity, where students must carefully move the undamaged eggs from the green bucket to a new nest. The students must place the eggs into the new nest one by one with great care, ensuring that they are not damaged during the relocation process. Once all the eggs have been successfully placed into the new nest, the students must carefully cover it with sand, place a protective cage over it, and put up a sign to let others know that a turtle egg nest is present. This activity teaches students the importance of preserving sea turtle nests and how to relocate them safely. It also helps students develop an appreciation for the efforts required to protect sea turtles and their habitats. The egg relocation activity provides an engaging and interactive learning experience for students to learn about the importance of conservation efforts in preserving sea turtles.

## Hypothetical ideas to come
- Marine Debris Cleanup: In this activity, students could be teleported to a virtual beach environment filled with marine debris, and they must pick up and properly dispose of the waste. This activity would teach students about the dangers of marine pollution and how it impacts sea turtles and their habitats.
- Hatchling Release: In this activity, students could be teleported to a virtual beach environment where they would release hatchlings into the ocean. This activity would teach students about the challenges hatchlings face and how conservation efforts help ensure their survival.

# Navigating
- If you are new to Unity it can seem a little overwhelming. Unity is a cross-platform game engine and development tool used to create video games, simulations, and other interactive content. It allows developers to create 2D and 3D games using a variety of programming languages such as C#, JavaScript, and Boo. Unity provides a range of tools, including a visual editor, animation tools, physics engine, and scripting system, that allow developers to build games and interactive experiences quickly and efficiently. It supports multiple platforms, including desktop, mobile, console, and VR devices, and offers a range of features such as real-time lighting, high-quality graphics, and advanced AI. With its powerful engine and intuitive interface, Unity is a popular choice for both novice and professional game developers, as well as for educators and students interested in learning game development.
-In this navigation we will be going through some of the main folders you will interact with. It is important to keep it organized the best that you can. 
  - Scenes 
    - Scenes in Unity are individual levels or environments that make up a game or interactive experience. A scene can be thought of as a self-contained unit of content that contains all of the game objects, lighting, audio, and other elements required for that particular level or environment. In Unity, scenes are created and managed using the Scene View, which is an editor window that allows developers to manipulate the objects and elements within a scene. Scenes can be created from scratch, or existing scenes can be opened and modified.
    - Here you can find a plethora of scenes including NewMain, newTutorial, Egg Sort, and many more. Double click to open up a scene to work on.<br><br>
    
  - Scripts
    - Scripts in Unity are code files that are written in a programming language such as C#, JavaScript, or Boo. They are used to add functionality and behavior to game objects, control game logic, and create interactive elements in a Unity project. A script can be attached to any game object in a Unity scene, and it can access and modify the object's properties and behavior. For example, a script attached to a player object can be used to control the player's movement, animations, and interactions with the game environment. Scripts in Unity are created and edited using an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio or MonoDevelop. Unity also includes a built-in code editor, called the Unity Editor, which can be used to write and modify scripts directly within the Unity interface. In addition to creating custom scripts, Unity also provides a range of pre-built scripts and components that can be used to add common functionality to a game, such as collision detection, input handling, and physics simulation. Scripts are an essential component of game development in Unity, and they provide a powerful and flexible way to add functionality and interactivity to game objects and create engaging gameplay experiences.
    - There are alot of scripts that you can see here. Before writing please make sure that the functionality that you are working on doesn't already exist to save you time. Please write and update comments so that people that work when you are gone can get a better understanding to your goal. <br><br>

  - AssetLibrary
    - Here you can find many different textures, animations, materials, models, and prefabs that have either come preinstalled or created by other students here at UNCW.<br><br>
